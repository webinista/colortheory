# Colors

I was bored, researching color theory and decided to build a thing. But it's really a way for me to finally get my head around the Reacty-Webpacky-Babeling  things by doing it from scratch (instead of guessing and poking at someone else's setup).

May not finish it though ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. 

# Setup (mostly for me, since I work on it as I have time)

- Clone this repository.
- Navigate to the `colortheory` directory
- Run `npm install` to install packages.
- Run `npm run watch` to start a webpack server that reloads when you save changes.
- Run `npm run test` to run tests.
- Run `npm build:production` to create a production build.
